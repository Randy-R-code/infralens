# InfraLens

**InfraLens** is a lightweight web inspection tool designed to quickly analyze the infrastructure, security, and technical signals of a website. It performs 16 independent checks across 6 categories using server-side execution.

### Key Features

- **16 comprehensive checks** across HTTP & Security, Network & DNS, Infrastructure, Website Structure, Metadata & Stack, and Performance
- **Weighted scoring system** with category breakdowns and letter grades (A–E)
- **Actionable recommendations** with step-by-step guidance for failed checks
- **Export functionality** to download results as JSON
- **Rate limiting** to protect services and prevent abuse
- **Type-safe architecture** with full TypeScript coverage
- **Modular design** for easy extension with additional checks

### Architecture

- Next.js 16 (App Router) with React Server Components
- Server Actions for all check execution
- Native Node.js DNS resolution with caching
- Parallel check execution for optimal performance
- In-memory rate limiting

InfraLens is **open source** (MIT License) and designed as a portfolio project, but its modular architecture makes it easy to extend with additional checks.
